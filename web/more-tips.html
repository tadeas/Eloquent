            <div class="tip-header">Research the audience</div>
            <div class="tip-content">
                Quoting Guy Kawasaki, "If you can prove to your audience in the first five minutes that 
                you understand who they are, you've got them for the rest of the speech."
                Understand the issues, competition and trends that the audience faces.
                You can speak to the organizer of the meeting and ask about the audience
                and their expectations as well as their demographics, age, background, gender, etc.
                If you present at an industry event, research the event web site and
                do a Google search about the industry in general. If you are presenting
                to a corporation, learn as much as you can about that corporation and
                what challenges it faces.

            <div class="tip-header">Get familiar with the room</div>
            <div class="tip-content">
                If it's possible, visit the talk location prior to the speaking event.
                See how the room will be laid out, make any requests for positioning
                any visual aid equipment. Check how big the room is and if you need a microphone.
                When you know what's ahead of you, you can prepare better. And what's
                most important, you'll be less anxious and more confident.

            <div class="tip-header">Talk to the audience before you start</div>
            <div class="tip-content">
                Greet the audience at the door. Ask questions to learn about their 
                expectations and level of knowledge. You are here to fulfill their
                expectations after all and delivering that will make a huge difference
                in how they perceive you. You'll also make a few friends and it
                always helps to have friends in the room.

        <div class="tip">
            <div class="tip-header">Exercise a bit before speaking</div>
            <div class="tip-content">
                Exercising lightly before a presentation can get your blood circulating
                and send more oxygen to your brain. Take a walk before the speech or 
                do a few squats or something similar.

            <div class="tip-header">Don't take audience too personally</div>
            <div class="tip-content">
                Have you ever been to an interesting speech, but were too tired
                to really pay attention?
                There is always going to be someone in the audience on their 
                phone or yawning. Remember that there will always be people who 
                are bored or tired. It's their problem, not yours. None of these 
                audience reactions have anything to do with you personally.

            <div class="tip-header">Practice in front of a mirror</div>
            <div class="tip-content">
                Recording and reviewing impromptu speech helps tremendously. 
                Watching yourself in the mirror a couple of times helps too. 
                Practice the speech as if you were speaking directly to someone. 
                Focus on your facial expressions, gestures, body movements, 
                how welcoming you appear in general. Gentle expressions and calm 
                demeanor make you appear more welcoming.

            <div class="tip-header">Talk about something your audience is interested in</div>
            <div class="tip-content">
                Sounds like a no brainer. But many otherwise intelligent people 
                talk about what they are interested in, rather than what the audience 
                is interested in. When speaking at a conference, people come to your session 
                because of the synopsis. That's what they're interested in. 
                Don't change it just because it suits you. Circulating with the audience 
                before the talk helps understanding the audience interests better.

            <div class="tip-header">Tell them why they should listen</div>
            <div class="tip-content">
                So the audience is interested in the topic you are going to speak about. 
                Great. Unfortunately, it's not always that way. In either, case it's good to sparkle 
                even more interest. How will the speech benefit them? Why should they care? 
                If you're speaking about health and safety, you can tell them 
                about a coworker who got injured in the workplace and what consequences it had for him.

            <div class="tip-header">Audience of two or two thousand?</div>
            <div class="tip-content">
                Everybody can deliver a great speech to an audience of two people. 
                How is it different from giving a speech to two thousand people? 
                Now it's a very public speech and we focus on the public part, 
                instead of the speaking part. To be an effective speaker, you must do 
                the opposite, focus on the speaking and let go the public. 
                With two people listening we have no problems being ourselves. 
                Just be yourself in front of two thousands too.

            <div class="tip-content">
                Even the most experienced speakers make mistakes. How do we know? 
                To err is human, so there simply must be some mistakes, even in the most 
                perfect speeches. But we don't notice. We don't know the speaker 
                left out a word, said a wrong name or skipped a page. Never apologize 
                for a minor slip. Unless the mistake was really earth shattering, they 
                didn't notice anyway, so don't tell them.

            <div class="tip-header">Make it personal</div>
            <div class="tip-content">
                People like to hear about other people's experiences. Their triumphs, 
                tragedies and everyday humorous anecdotes, anything the audience
                can identify with. Whenever possible, insert a personal element 
                in the speech. Tell stories. Taking inspiration from sales and marketing,
                use "customer personas" to give examples.

        <div class="tip">
            <div class="tip-header">Entertain</div>
            <div class="tip-content">
                The primary goal of the speech is to entertain the audience. 
                If people enjoy it, you can slip in some information. But if the speech 
                is utterly dull, no amount of information will make it great. 
                If we could pick between an entertaining and informative speech, 
                most people would choose the entertaining one. Some informing can happen too.

            <div class="tip-header">Change grabs attention</div>
            <div class="tip-content">
                We notice change. You notice the hum of the air-conditioner when 
                it comes on and when it goes off - but not in between. 
                You can use this natural human propensity to retrieve your audience's 
                attention. Switch from slides to flipchart and back again. Show a short video. 
                Change speaking style according to the content. When making 
                statements of fact, use a measured, deliberate tone and stand still. 
                When telling a story, speed up and move around.

            <div class="tip-content">
                Unless microphones are available, rarely will everyone in the audience 
                hear questions other audience members ask. Always repeat the question 
                and then answer it. It's not only courteous, but it also provides you 
                with a little more time to think of an awesome way to answer each question. 
                And you'll make sure that you understood the question right too.
